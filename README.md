This repository contains a model of a cam shaft that has been designed and simulated using SolidWorks and MSC Adams. The cam shaft is based on a real car's cam shaft and includes the determination of the angle of the remaining shaft, as well as the implementation of contact and spring elements in MSC Adams.

## Introduction

The cam shaft is a crucial component in an internal combustion engine, responsible for controlling the opening and closing of the engine's valves. This repository presents a detailed model of a cam shaft that closely resembles the design of a cam shaft found in a real car. The model has been developed using SolidWorks, a popular computer-aided design (CAD) software, and simulated using MSC Adams, a multi-body dynamics simulation software.

## SolidWorks Modeling

The cam shaft model was created in SolidWorks, following the design specifications of a real car's cam shaft. The SolidWorks model includes the accurate geometry and dimensions of the cam lobes, journals, and remaining shaft. The model has been created with precision to ensure a realistic representation of the cam shaft.

## MSC Adams Simulation

After the completion of the SolidWorks model, the cam shaft was imported into MSC Adams for simulation purposes. In MSC Adams, contact and spring elements were defined to simulate the interactions between various components of the cam shaft during its operation. The contact elements were utilized to model the contact forces between the cam lobes and the engine's valve lifters, while the spring elements were used to simulate the spring-back effect caused by the valve springs.
